# Context7
- **Always use the context7 MCP server** to reference the latest documentation for libraries and frameworks like Redwood GraphQL, Prisma, and Clerk.
- For the tokens, **start with 8000** but then increase to __20000__ if your first search didn't give relevant documentation.
- **Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation.** If you don't get what you need, use the Brave search MCP if you can to perform a wider search.

# EcoExpense Project Intelligence

## EcoExpense Overview
- EcoExpense is a RedwoodJS application for tracking both financial expenses and environmental impact
- Core features include expense tracking, emissions calculation, and reporting
- Multi-tenant architecture with organizations, projects, trips, and expenses
- Data models include currency conversion to NOK and emissions tracking

## Key Workflows
- Organizations contain users, projects, and suppliers
- Projects organize trips and expenses
- Trips group related expenses with travel information
- Expenses track both financial data and environmental impact
- Environment impact calculated across three scopes of emissions

## Important Patterns
- Use organization context for all data queries to maintain multi-tenant isolation
- Ensure proper currency conversion for all expense amounts
- Calculate and track emissions data for relevant expenses
- Follow RedwoodJS conventions for cells, services, and components
- Use shadcn/ui components with Tailwind styling whereever possible. Always use the rw-shad cli to install new components.

## File Locations
- GraphQL schemas in `api/src/graphql/*.sdl.ts`
- Database models in `api/db/schema.prisma`
- Services (business logic) in `api/src/services/`
- UI components in `web/src/components/`
- Pages in `web/src/pages/`

## Data Model Details
- Organizations are the top-level entity for multi-tenancy
- Users belong to a specific organization
- Projects organize expenses and belong to organizations
- Trips belong to projects and contain multiple expenses
- Expenses track financial and emissions data
- Categories have both English and Norwegian names

## Key Conventions

### 1. Version & Tooling
- RedwoodJS 8.5.0 is used throughout the project with Yarn 4.
- Run `yarn rw prisma migrate dev` to apply schema changes.
- Use Redwood's dev commands:
  - `yarn rw dev` (local dev)
  - `yarn rw test` (tests)
  - `yarn rw storybook` (Storybook dev)

### 2. TypeScript
- Strict mode is enabled.
- Ensure all services, GraphQL resolvers, and React components adhere to strong typing.

### 3. Prisma & Models
- Refer to `/api/db/schema.prisma` for model definitions.
- Models use **PascalCase** names (User, Organization, Project, etc.).
- Field names appear in **camelCase** (e.g. organizationId, clerkId).
- Enum names in ALL_CAPS or PascalCase (e.g. `USER_STATUS`, `ReimbursementStatus`).

### 4. Auth with Clerk
- Clerk is integrated via `@clerk/express`.
- Redwood config uses `clerkAuthDecoder` in `api/src/functions/auth.ts` or similar.
- The `User` model may include `clerkId` for references.
- Roles come from Clerk's session or metadata, verified in Redwood's `getCurrentUser` or services.

### 5. shadcn/ui
- Components installed via rw-shad or shadcn CLI.
- Placed in `web/src/components/ui`.
- Import pattern:
  ```tsx
  import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button'
  ```
- Customize via Tailwind classes in `className` props.

### 6. Testing (Jest)
- Files named `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`.
- Use Redwood's helpers:
  ```ts
  import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@redwoodjs/testing/web'
  ```
- Colocate test files with their corresponding services, pages, or components.

### 7. Storybook
- Redwood config in `web/.storybook`.
- Place stories in `web/src/stories` or next to components as `*.stories.tsx`.
- CSF 3.0 format + TypeScript meta:
  ```tsx
  import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
  import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button'

  const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
    title: 'UI/Button',
    component: Button,
  }
  export default meta
  type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>

  export const Primary: Story = {
    args: {
      variant: 'default',
      children: 'Click me',
    },
  }
  ```

### 8. Redwood Patterns
- **Cells** for data fetching. Example:
  ```tsx
  export const Success = ({ expenses }) => {
    return expenses.map(...)
  }
  ```
- **Scaffolding** usage:
  ```bash
  yarn rw g scaffold expense
  ```
- Redwood's built-in components like `<Form>` used with shadcn UI parts.

### 9. Schema Conventions
- The `schema.prisma` file includes relations (one-to-many, etc.).
- Foreign keys often in `camelCase` (e.g. `organizationId`, `userId`).
- Use Redwood's recommended approach for migrations:
  ```bash
  yarn rw prisma migrate dev
  ```
- Keep enum usage consistent with the existing models (ex. `USER_STATUS`).

### 10. Styling & Layout
- Tailwind CSS 3 under Redwood's default setup.
- Redwood's scaffold-generated CSS in `web/src/scaffold.css` for Redwood forms, table, etc.
- Additional custom classes for shadcn/ui in `web/src/components/ui/` or global styles.
- css classes prefixed with `rw-` for Redwood-specific styles. These styles are defined in `web/src/scaffold.css`

### 11. Common Patterns & Reminders
- Validate user input in service functions.
- Redwood's `requireAuth` or role-based checks in GraphQL SDL or services.
- For multi-tenant or org-level logic, pass `organizationId` to service queries.
- After updates, run `yarn rw type-check` to ensure consistent types.
- Keep test coverage for cells, components, and services.
- Use Redwood's recommended directory structure for maintainability.
